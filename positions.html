        <p>
        We believe that meaningful scientific progress happens when people from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives come together in an environment built on respect, fairness, and belonging. In the Tatonetti Lab, we value curiosity, empathy, and collaboration. We are committed to understanding how structural and societal factors shape health and science and to ensuring that our work reflects this awareness. We strive to create a space where every lab member feels supported to grow, contribute, and challenge assumptions in the pursuit of better science and a healthier society.
