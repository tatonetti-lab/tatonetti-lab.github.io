            <p><strong>Internships</strong></p>
            <p>
                We offer summer internship opportunities every year, allowing interns to collaborate with and learn from our 
                lab members. We welcome applications from students enrolled in a BSc or MS. Applications for the 2025 Summer Internship are closed. Check back next year!

        <p><strong>Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging Statement</strong></p>
        <p>
        We believe that meaningful scientific progress happens when people from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives come together in an environment built on respect, fairness, and belonging. In the Tatonetti Lab, we value curiosity, empathy, and collaboration. We are committed to understanding how structural and societal factors shape health and science and to ensuring that our work reflects this awareness. We strive to create a space where every lab member feels supported to grow, contribute, and challenge assumptions in the pursuit of better science and a healthier society.
