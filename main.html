        <p>We are making drugs safer through the analysis of data. Everyday millions of us
            or our loved ones take medications to manage our health. We trust in these
            prescriptions to improve our lives and give us hope for a healthier future.
            Often, however, these drugs have harmful side effects or dangerous interactions.
            Adverse drug reactions are experienced by millions of patients each year and
            cost the healthcare industry billions of dollars. In the Tatonetti Lab we use
            advanced data science methods, including artificial intelligence and machine
            learning, to investigate these medicines. Using emerging resources, such as
            electronic health records (EHR) and genomics databases, we are working to
            identify for whom these drugs will be safe and effective and for whom they will
            not. <a href="http://tatonettilab.org/projects/">Browse</a> our databases, <a

    <h3>2024 TLab Internship Opportunities</h3>
    <div class="date">January 5, 2024</div>
    <div class="news-content">

        <p>TLab has summer internship opportunities in data science and health AI. As a
            summer research intern in the Tatonetti Lab at Cedars-Sinai you will conduct
            research to improve drug safety by leveraging clinical and molecular data. In
            the Tatonetti Lab, we use advanced data science methods, including artificial
            intelligence and machine learning, to investigate drug safety, drug-drug
            interactions, and cancer pharmacology. Using emerging resources, such as
            electronic health records (EHR) and genomics databases, we are working to
            advance the science of pharmacology with a focus on serving traditionally
            underrepresented populations.</p>



        <p>Responsibilities include querying databases, data processing, supervised and
            unsupervised machine learning, deploying production models, and communication of
            scientific findings via peer-reviewed publications and scientific conferences.
            Writes clean, performant, reusable code managed on GitHub to perform repeatable
            analyses and to train and deploy models to multiple environments.</p>



        <p>APPLICATION PROCESS HAS CLOSED</p>

    <h3>TLab moves to LA üèñÔ∏è</h3>
    <div class="date">January 9, 2023</div>
    <div class="news-content">

        <p>I‚Äôm excited to share that I have joined the faculty at Cedars-Sinai in Los
            Angeles as Vice Chair of Computational Biomedicine and Associate Director of the
            Cancer Center! My group will continue to advance state-of-the-art of drug side
            effect and DDI research, biomedical data mining and AI, and translational
            bioinformatics. In addition, these leadership positions will bring opportunities
            to implement DS/AI into the clinical and research workflow at one of our
            nation‚Äôs top hospitals.</p>



        <p>I am so grateful to Columbia DBMI and all that we have accomplished over the past
            10 years. Read the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tlab-moves-los-angeles-nicholas-tatonetti">full
