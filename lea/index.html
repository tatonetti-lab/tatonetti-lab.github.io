<h2>Lab Enrichment Analysis (LEA): Automatic characterization of clinical cohorts using clinical pathology reports</h2>

Non-communicable diseases surpassed communicable diseases and neonatal conditions as the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. These diseases manifest over decades and their etiologies are complex and often unknown. The emergence of electronic health records – which annually capture millions of patient encounters with the health care system in a computable form – presents an unprecedented opportunity to study chronic illnesses in situ. Unfortunately, clinically characterizing these patients in noisy and error-prone heath record data remains a significant research challenge. Due to issues of noise, medical practice bias, standardization, and missingness, the data often do not faithfully represent the patient state. Clinical pathology reports, which are the result of laboratory analyses of bodily fluids, conform to a controlled vocabulary and are stored in a highly structured format, making them amenable for computational analyses. However, like a single gene’s expression in the transcriptome, the information contained in any single report is limited. Here, we present Lab Enrichment Analysis (LEA), an automated data-driven method to aggregate clinical pathology reports and identify common clinical themes. Modeled after its genetic namesake (GSEA), LEA is a knowledge-based system that integrates laboratory data with clinical ontologies of symptoms and diseases. We applied LEA to four disease cohorts – atrial fibrillation (AF), multiple sclerosis (MS), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and demonstrated our ability to characterize these cohorts accurately by identifying secondary phenotypes (i.e. co-morbidities). Using LEA we highlighted established comorbidities, such as dementia (AF), sleep disorders (MS), and bone metabolism impairment (T2DM), and identified novel associations, such as dementia (PAD). Importantly, because we use only the clinical pathology reports, other health data, including the medications, diseases, and notes, are available for secondary analysis. We demonstrate LEA’s utility for evaluating comorbidities and patient outcomes and provide LEA as a freely available tool for exploring clinical cohorts.
