      <h3>Off-label and polypharmacy side effect databases</h3>
      <p>
        The Offsides database is a resource of 438,801 off-label -- those effects not listed
        on the FDA's official drug label -- side 
        effects for 1332 drugs and 10,097 adverse events. The average drug label lists 
        69 "on-label" adverse events. We list an average of 329 high-confidence off-label 
        adverse events for each drug. For comparison, the SIDER database, extracted from 
        drug package inserts, lists 48,577 drug-event associations for 620 drugs and 1092 
        adverse events that are also covered by the data mining. OFFSIDES recovers 38.8% 
        (18,842 drug-event associations) of SIDER associations from the adverse event 
        reports. Thus, OFFSIDES finds different associations from those reported during 
        clinical trials before drug approval.

        The Twosides databases is a resource of polypharmacy side effects for pairs of drugs. 
        This database contains 868,221 significant associations between 59,220 pairs of drugs 
        and 1301 adverse events. These associations are limited to only those that cannot be 
        clearly attributed to either drug alone (that is, those associations covered in OFFSIDES). 
        The database contains an additional 3,782,910 significant associations for which the 
        drug pair has a higher side-effect association score, determined using the proportional 
        reporting ratio (PRR), than those of the individual drugs alone.
